##Cost of Information
    Grossman and Stiglitz said that since information is costly prices won't reflect perfectly available information.  This is because if it did those who spent resources to obtain it wouldn't receive any reward for it.  This concludes that an informational efficient market is impossible.

##Realism of information efficiency
    Prefect efficiency is something that is unrealistic in not only practice but also in theory as well.  If there are costs to information then abnormal returns will exist.  It is necessary for abnormal returns to compensate people for gathering information and processing.

##Information cost cycle
    The last point that they make that I will mention is that if information has a cost then people will pay to get such information.  As this happens more and more people will pay to have an information advantage until it no longer becomes an advantage because this information will already be represented in the market price.  When this happens people will stop paying for information and make better returns because they will not have to fork out money for this information.  People will catch onto the fact that this paid for information is already in the price and that people make better returns for not paying for information and will stop paying for it.  This then will eventually will create an environment where this paid for information is not reflected in the price and people will pay for this information and this whole thing becomes cyclical.
