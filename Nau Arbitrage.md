##Standard Theory of rational choice
    Environment
        made up of agents, events, consequences and acts
    Behavior
        physical behavior
            choices among alternatives
        mental behavior
            preferences among acts
    Rationality
        individual rationality
        strategic rationality
        competitive rationality
        social rationality
        rational asset pricing
        rational learning
        rational expectations
    Rationality is explaining basically that people will act in there own interests in each of these situations.  There are several different situations.  The firt is the agent, the second the small group and the third the large group.  It is saying that it doesn't care how the individual acts but how the group acts.  The individual is more likely to act irrationally than the large group per say.
    
##Results
    four different results
        result 1
            every agent must act in a way that maximizes expected utility in respect to some utility function and probability distribution
        result 2
            the agents jointly must behave as if implementing a competitive equilibrium in a market or a strategic equilibrium in a game
        result 3
           if there is uncertainty, there must exist a “common prior” probability distribution
        result 4
            whene agents anticipate the receipt of information, they must expect their beliefs to be updated according to Bayes Theorem
